- Shows timestamp, request/response hex, and decoded content

### PLC Controller

Supports Modbus communication with major PLC brands:
- **Brands**: Siemens, Mitsubishi, Delta, Omron, Custom
- **Data Types**: BOOL, UINT16, INT16, UINT32, FLOAT
- Register table shows address, name, type, value, scale factor, unit
- BOOL registers can be toggled via checkbox
- Supports read-all and single-read modes
- Auto-poll mode with configurable interval (200-10000ms)

### File Transfer

Transfer files via serial port with these protocols:
- **XMODEM** — Basic checksum
- **XMODEM-CRC** — CRC checksum, more reliable
- **YMODEM** — Supports file name and size info
- **ZMODEM** — Advanced protocol with resume support

Workflow: Select protocol → Click send/receive → Choose file → Wait for completion

### Frame Builder

Manually construct Modbus frames:
1. Set slave ID, function code, address, value
2. Click "Build" to generate hex frame
3. Click "Send" to transmit via serial port

### Data Logger

## Tips

- When debugging a new device, start with **115200** baud rate
- If you don't know the baud rate, use the **Auto** button
- In HEX mode, sending data automatically strips spaces and `0x` prefixes
- You can append **CRC checksums** when sending text for data integrity
- **Auto Reply** is useful for protocol debugging that requires responses
- Use **Record/Replay** to quickly repeat test sequences
- For Modbus debugging, use "Quick Request" first to verify connectivity, then "Register Monitor" for continuous observation
- PLC controller supports custom brands — import your own register definitions

## Shortcuts

- **Enter** — Send data in terminal input box
- **Ctrl+C** — Copy selected text in terminal

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Port list is empty?**
A: Click the refresh button `↻`. If still empty, check if the device is connected and drivers are installed. Linux users may need `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` for serial port permissions.

**Q: No data received after connecting?**
A: Check that the baud rate matches the device settings, verify wiring (TX/RX cross-connected), and check flow control settings.

**Q: Auto baud rate detection fails?**
A: Ensure the device is sending data. Auto-detection requires data output during the connection attempt.

**Q: Modbus communication no response?**
A: Check slave address, verify function code and address range, validate CRC checksum.

**Q: File transfer fails?**
A: Ensure both sides use the same protocol, check serial connection stability, try lowering the baud rate.
