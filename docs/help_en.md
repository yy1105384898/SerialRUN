- You can append **CRC checksums** when sending text for data integrity
- **Auto Reply** is useful for protocol debugging that requires responses
- Use **Record/Replay** to quickly repeat test sequences
- For Modbus debugging, use "Quick Request" first to verify connectivity, then "Register Monitor" for continuous observation
- PLC controller supports custom brands — import your own register definitions
- All configuration and logs auto-save to `~/.serialrun/` directory, survives restart

## Recording & Replay

SerialRUN supports recording serial operations and replaying them for repeated test sequences.

### Recording

1. Find the "Record / Replay" section in the left panel
2. Click **Start Recording** — status bar shows red `● Recording`
3. Use the terminal normally to send data (all sent commands are recorded, including timing intervals)
4. Click **Stop Recording** — shows the number of recorded commands

### Saving Scripts

After recording, click the **Save** button:
- Supports `.txt` and `.srs` formats
- Script files are plain text, one command per line:
  - `SEND data content` — send command
  - `WAIT milliseconds` — wait for specified time

### Loading Scripts

Click the **Import** button to load a previously saved script file.

### Replaying

1. Ensure serial device is connected
2. Click the green **▶ Replay** button
3. Script executes automatically with recorded timing intervals
4. Progress bar shows current progress
5. Click red **■ Stop** at any time to interrupt replay

### Script File Example

```
# SerialRUN Script
SEND AT
WAIT 500
SEND AT+RST
WAIT 1000
SEND AT+CWMODE=1
```

## Terminal Advanced Features

### HEX Mode

The terminal supports independent TX/RX HEX modes:
- **TX HEX** — When checked, input is parsed as hexadecimal (e.g., `48 65 6C 6C 6F`)
- **RX HEX** — When checked, received data displays as space-separated hex (e.g., `4F 4B 0D 0A`)
- Supports `0x` prefixes (e.g., `0x48 0x65`), auto-strips spaces

### Line Endings

Automatically append line endings when sending text:
- **None** — No characters appended
- **CR (\r)** — Carriage return, common for serial terminals
- **LF (\n)** — Line feed, common for network protocols
- **CRLF (\r\n)** — CR+LF, HTTP/Modbus ASCII standard

### Auto Send

Click **Auto** to repeatedly send the input content at a set interval:
- Configurable interval (100ms - 60s)
- Useful for heartbeat packets, polling requests, etc.
- Click **Stop Auto** to cancel

### DTR/RTS Control

When connected, DTR and RTS checkboxes appear in the terminal toolbar:
- **DTR (Data Terminal Ready)** — Data terminal ready signal
- **RTS (Request To Send)** — Request to send signal
- Some devices (e.g., Arduino) require DTR to be asserted for communication

### Keep Input

The **Keep input** checkbox on the left of the terminal input:
- When checked, sent data is not cleared from the input box
- Useful for repeatedly sending the same command during debugging
- Default: off (input clears after sending)

### Checksum

Automatically append checksums when sending, supporting 8 algorithms:
- **CRC-16/MODBUS** — Modbus RTU standard (polynomial 0xA001)
- **CRC-16/CCITT** — CCITT standard (polynomial 0x1021)
- **CRC-16/XMODEM** — XMODEM file transfer protocol
- **CRC-32** — 32-bit CRC (ZIP/Ethernet)
- **LRC** — Longitudinal Redundancy Check (Modbus ASCII)
- **Checksum-8** — 8-bit additive
- **Checksum-16** — 16-bit additive

Hover over algorithm names in the Checksum panel for detailed descriptions.

All serial operations are routed through the GUI's port manager, ensuring no conflict with GUI operations.

### Setup

In the left settings panel, find "MCP Server":
1. Check "Enable MCP Server"
2. Set the port number (default 9527)
3. Choose bind address:
   - **Localhost only** — Only local AI assistants can connect (recommended)
   - **All interfaces (LAN)** — Allow LAN AI assistants to connect

### Available Tools (11)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_ports` | List all available serial ports |
| `connect` | Connect to serial port (supports baud rate, data bits, stop bits, parity) |
| `disconnect` | Disconnect from current connection |

- Left settings panel shows last 20 access records
- Color coded: 🟢 CONNECT, 🔴 DISCONNECT, 🔵 CALL
- Query full log via `get_access_log` tool

### LAN Mode

When LAN mode is enabled:
- Shows your local IP address and port (e.g., `192.168.1.100:9527`)
- AI assistants on other LAN devices can connect
- All operations are automatically logged with client IP (use `get_access_log` tool to view)
- ⚠️ Use with caution — anyone on the network can control serial ports

## Data Persistence

SerialRUN automatically saves the following data to `~/.serialrun/` directory:

| File | Content | Save Trigger |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `config.toml` | Theme, language, baud rate, etc. | When settings change |
| `logs.json` | Log records | Auto-save every 10 entries |
| `terminal.json` | Terminal send/receive records | Auto-save every 5 entries |

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Port list is empty?**
A: Click the refresh button `↻`. If still empty, check if the device is connected and drivers are installed. Linux users may need 
`sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` for serial port permissions.

**Q: No data received after connecting?**
A: Check that the baud rate matches the device settings, verify wiring (TX/RX cross-connected), and check flow control settings.

**Q: Auto baud rate detection fails?**
A: Ensure the device is sending data. Auto-detection requires data output during the connection attempt.

**Q: Modbus communication no response?**
A: Check slave address, verify function code and address range, validate CRC checksum.

**Q: PLC register shows ERR?**
A: The register read failed. Check wiring, slave ID, and ensure the register address exists on the PLC.

**Q: How to use MCP server?**
A: The MCP server is enabled by default on port 9527 (localhost). Configure in Settings > MCP Server:
- Change port number if 9527 is occupied
- Enable "All interfaces (LAN)" to allow remote AI assistants to connect
- AI assistants can control serial ports via MCP protocol (see Help > MCP Guide)

**Q: File transfer fails?**
A: Ensure both sides use the same protocol, check serial connection stability, try lowering the baud rate.

**Q: Data lost after restart?**
A: All data is auto-saved to `~/.serialrun/` directory. Check if the directory exists and has write permissions.
